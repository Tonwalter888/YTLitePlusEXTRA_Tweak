# YTweaks

Adds a few extra options to the iOS YouTube app:
- Fullscreen to Right
- Fullscreen to Left
- Disable floating Miniplayer

More settings may be added if I find them useful. Designed to work with a [fork of YTLite](https://github.com/fosterbarnes/YTLite) (also known as [YouTube Plus](https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite)).

## Supported YouTube versions

Confirmed version 20.20.7 - 20.50.9. Lower/higher are either untested or unsupported.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to PoomSmart for making the various tweaks that made this possible. This tweak is essentially a stripped down fork of https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTABConfig
