# YTweaks

Working features:
- **Fullscreen to the right or left**: Locks fullscreen orientation.
- **Disable floating miniplayer**: Restores the old miniplayer by disabling the floating miniplayer.
- **Virtual fullscreen bezels**: Adds invisible touch-safe zones on black bars to prevent accidental taps and skips.

Experimental:
- **Hide AI Summaries**: Attempts to block/hide AI summaries below videos in the home feed.

More settings will most likely be added in the future. Designed to work with a [fork of YTLite](https://github.com/fosterbarnes/YTPlusYTweaks/) (also known as [YouTube Plus](https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite)).
